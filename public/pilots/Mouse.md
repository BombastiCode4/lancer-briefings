# Union Auxiliary Frame Pilot Amana Sevaro - Observation Notes
We have had our fair share of colourful recruits. That operator who was actually the bastard son of a disbanded Karrakin House, the singer that was actually an idol who had 3/6th of her fanbase enlist alongside her, and the technician that claimed they were the head of a HORUS cell.
On the matter of Second Lieutenant (O-1) Sevaro, nothing initially seems abnormal. Her aptitudes are stellar, especially in the realm of digital integrations. She completed the Eratosus Computational Examination in under an hour, breaking the last record. Through interfacing with Keltas, the local training NHP, rapport was developed within fifteen minutes. We've already prepared for her the Chomolungma frame for deployment. However, we found out that she already had one delivered to her post-haste from another address, 3rd party yet well connected to numerous Union officials...

It's a Nepo-Baby. We have a Nepo-Baby.
