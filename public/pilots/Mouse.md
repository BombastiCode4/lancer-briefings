# Union Auxiliary Frame Pilot Sam - Observation Notes
An interesting addition to the Union Auxiliary Pilot program, CSN-392 or 'Sam' is one of the members of the Penal Rehabilitative Combat Brigade temporarily reassigned to the Marigold. Most of their record is Redacted, so clearly someone in the top brass wants their history kept under wraps. Regardless, they show competence in a variety of fields, namely reaction speed and dexterity. 
While I'm concerned with why we have a convict with our team, it is clear that they are a potent access and, with enough surveillance, CSN-392 will be a problem for the Aun instead of us.
