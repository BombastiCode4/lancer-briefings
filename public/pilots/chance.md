# Union Auxiliary Frame Pilot Lucian Manifold - OBSERVATION NOTES
It's not everyday that a champion of any sport becomes a soldier, especially a poker champion. When Second Lieutenant Manifold's name came across my desk, I was taken aback. I recognized this damn name! He's the damn reason one of my buddies on the UNS Etria is down 2000 manna and counting. I'm honestly surprised that someone of his nature even joined the force. What's the story, huh? Maybe he's got a lover on Cornucopia? Actually, he might have lost a big game and is using the 3rd Annamite to escape? Psh- regardless, for all the cons this poker man has, his aptitudes for close quarters combat are pretty up there. We threw him up against two H.A Tokugawas and just with the standard issue chargeblade he gave them a run for their manna! We've been looking into augmenting the chargeblade, but I have a feeling this guy might be one of those cocky ones... Don't want him to develop any uncontrollable egos before he has an opportunity to show what he can actually do on the field.

P.S Avoid playing this guy on the table. He'll win the entire fleet's betting pool.
