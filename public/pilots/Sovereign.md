# Union Auxiliary Frame Pilot Sasha Corey - OBSERVATION NOTES
1st Lieutenant Sasha Corey. Her file says that she's a transfer from the Union Special Operations Brigade 6th Division, but I'll admit, I wouldn't be surprised if she's actually with the Investigative Bureau. Everybody here knows how much those blacksite guys enjoy keeping eyes and ears everywhere. Disregarding that, Lieutenant Corey has a clean history of successful operations under her belt. Termination of multiple warlords in the Diaspora, the arrests of corrupt officials aligned with HORUS, and the application of gunboat diplomacy to prevent a larger skirmish between the Baronies and Harrison Armory. Her skills both inside and outside the frame will be appreciated in the coming fight.
