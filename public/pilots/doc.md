# Union Auxiliary Pilot Figaro Garcia - Observation Notes

Records show that Second Lieutenant Garcia was an EMT before joining the 3rd Annamite. While a frame doesn't bleed... Wait- scratch that, there are definitely a couple of frames that could probably bleed. Regardless, OUR frames don't bleed. It doesn't mean that having someone with previous medical experience isn't a boon to troop morale. The marines and ground crews will love this one when they come saving the day. They say that the Hippocratic Oath encourages a doctor to "do no harm", but I have no doubt that Second Lieutenant Garcia will do plenty of harm from afar. Their sharpshooter scores blew Captain Mateo's previous high right out of orbit. We're expecting great things from Garcia, both inside the frame and out.

... Wait, did anybody check the expiry date on that medical license?
