# Mission // #002
## Vigilant Gaze

Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.  
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.
