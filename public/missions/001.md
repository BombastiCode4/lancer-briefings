# Mission // #001
## Feet Into Hell
# Goals
- Secure landing zones for allied forces
- Eliminate hostile anti-aircraft elements
- Assist local defenders

# Stakes
- Should we fail to secure the landing zones, the enemy will be free to focus their attention on the currently landed Union forces, leading to increased enemy resistance.
- The Aun forces will consolidate their forces, and it is likely multiple sections of the Cornucopia Revolutionary Guard will collapse.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
